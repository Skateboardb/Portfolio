				<h2>1. Userbase </h2>
				<img class="graph" src="https://i.imgur.com/Mf2himO.png" alt="Facebook usage graph" />
				<p> As of the 4th Quarter of 2017, there were over 2 billion active users per month; that is to say, with the widest 
				reach of any other social media platform, Facebook isn't expected to go anywhere anytime soon. 
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>2. Activity</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/j5oUiFa.jpg" alt="Facebook user"/>
				<p>According to Facebook's own most recent report on the subject, there are more than 1.4 billion people logging on using various 
				devices <i>every day.</i> Not only are there a lot of people using it, but the vast majority of those who do are doing
				so very consistently. 
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>3. Data</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MLU81hj.jpg" alt="Data center"/>
				<p>Facebook has revealed that their data centers process over 500 terabytes of data every single day. This includes
				the wealth of information that is collected so that ads are delivered to the right people. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>4. Targeting </h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9VcGDaP.png" alt="core audiences"/>
				<p>All of that public data collected by Facebook can be put to good use by targeting core audiences for advertising.
				The mechanisms for doing just this are so robust that 95% of social media
				experts agree that Facebook is the most valuable tool for accomplishing a variety of tasks with their ads 
				including brand awareness, lead generation, and conversion. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>5. Local-Friendly</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6JL2EfB.jpg" alt="local friendly"/>
				<p>Although there are well over 50 million businesses with pages on facebook, only about 10% of them are 
				actively using Business Manageer to promote their posts; this means that it doesn't reqire a huge ad budget 
				to ensure that you're reaching your local audience. </p>
				
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>6. Community Engagement</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pXl9ERB.gif" alt="emoji gif"/>
				<p>A large part of the purpose of using Facebook's business pages even without advertising is for the sake of having an online
				presence where your audience already is. It's good to have a website, but a page where members of the community are reacting 
				to your posts and communicating with each other is just the sort of friendly atmosphere that helps expand your organic reach. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>7. Reviews</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/O2Oia2B.jpg" alt="reviews on facebook"/>
				<p>Not long ago, sites like Yelp were the go-to source of information about public opinion regarding restaurants. 
				These days, people who are already scrolling through their Facebook feeds are likely to look for what they might want to eat
				without leaving the app or site. Further, the reviews on Business Pages come across as more personable and authentic because 
				users can get a glimpse of the people leaving the messages, for better or worse. Rections to ads are powerful tools for inviting people 
				who are already interested in what you have to offer to like your page. This gives you a better chance of reaching them both through paid
				advertising and organically in the future. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>8. Algorithm Changes</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JO1e56N.png" alt="algorithm scary looking image" />
				<p>I've made a couple of statements about organic reach, so let's talk about that - unless a post goes viral (which
				is a real possibility if you post good quality content), organic reach is decreasing overall for business pages. Business reach 
				has long been approaching a pay-to-play status, and the time has come for businesses to consider including paid reach on Facebook 
				in any marketing strategy. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>9. Trackable</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UtqltN4.png" alt="tracking"/>
				<p>One of the best things about Facebook ads is the ability to monitor the performance of your ads, so there's never any
				guesswork involved with determining the efficacy of a particular ad campaign. Whether you're running the ads yourself
				or working with a specialist, you should be able to see exactly how well each ad is doing and measure it against
				your standard for success. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>10. Testable</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4bxvYdw.png?1" alt="split test"/>
				<p>It's valuable enough to have information on how well an ad is doing; what's better is having the ability to 'share'
				an ad budget between two versions of the same ad to help detect seemingly minor differences between advertisements 
				which can actually make a huge impact on an ad's performance such as a change in wording in the copy or a different 
				image in the creative. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>11. Scalable</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/posanau.jpg" alt="scaling graph"/>
				<p>Once you're got a winning formula with an adset, it's easy to create an increase in response by simply increasing
				the ad budget. In other words, you can personally reach the people who work in a block around your location or put your
				content in front of everyone within a metropolitain area. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="entry">
				<h2>12. Lowest CPC</h2>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/51meHQr.jpg" alt="opportunity"/>
				<p>Perhaps the most exciting thing of all about Facebook advertising is that it is in a place of incredible 
				effectiveness and very low barrier to entry. To put things in perspective, the last major platform to offer such inexpensive
				and effective advertising was Google with AdWords in the early 2000s. Anyone who wastes no time in moving into paid 
				promotion on Facebook will be poised to benefit from a major marketing opportunity the likes of which will not be seen again for quite some time. </p>
